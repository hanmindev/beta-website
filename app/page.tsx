    <p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. I'm mainly interested in back-end development
      and systems programming, but I'm always looking to learn new things!</p>

    <p>Currently I am working on a custom compiler written in Rust to convert my Ingot programming language to
      Minecraft's .mcfunction format.</p>
